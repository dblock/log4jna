Log4jna is a library of native appenders for [log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/). Unlike the native implementation(s) in Log4j, this project uses [JNA](http://github.com/twall/jna) and therefore does not require a native DLL in a system directory or on PATH.

* [org.apache.log4jna.nt.Win32EventLogAppender](log4jna/tree/master/doc/org.apache.log4jna.nt.Win32EventLogAppender.md): a replacement for NTEventLogAppender based on JNA that doesn't require a native DLL in a system directory.
